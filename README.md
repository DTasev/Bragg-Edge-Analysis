# Bragg-Edge-Analysis

This project is a tool for analysing Neutron imaging data generated by the MCP detector at ISIS, RAL UK.
It allows a user to visualise their data, view transmission profiles, Z-axis profiles and to fit an analytical function 
to a selected Bragg edge, all via a GUI built in TKinter.
